# coding-progress-quiz

Check your code progress by a challenge quiz

## Motivation

To create a progress tracker in the form of a quiz which will challenge bootcamp students knowledge of javascript. Also, this progress tracker is
an example of an interview coding assessment. The challenge is a timed multiple choice quiz which saves results to the local storage after initials have been entered and the score displayed, hence if time runs out the quiz score will be zero. The user will be able to clear the score and/or go back to the start of the quiz.

## Build status

There is no supplied code and there should be no css file except for responsiveness as the css will be dynamic.

## Features

The following have been applied to the code:

1. Create two html files, one for the quiz and the second to display the score saved in the local storage.
2. In the index.html create a starter page with an introduction to the quiz and a button to start the quiz.
3. Display one multiple choice question and start the timer.
4. If the quiz is completed before time runs out save the score and display this along with a prompt for the user to input their initials.
   When the user clicks the submission button the view score is displayed allowing the user to clear their score and/or start the quiz again.
5. If the timer runs out a zero score is recorded and the user can still add their initials to indicate their progress, then can clear or restart the quiz.
